# Portfolio

If you want to clone this for yourself, fork it, and delete the `art` and `photography` folder.

Use `portfolio-script --help` to get started.

Page structure (pass the page folder as a directory argument)
```
root
-- page (folder)
     -- content (folder for images)
          -- carousels (folders - these will go under one entry with little arrows)
               -- images (files)
          -- images (files)
```
